Keep things simple and have a good codebase.
When uncertain about something investigate it through the web. 
If you don't know something admit it.
Don't overengineer: Simple beats complex
No fallbacks: One correct path, no alternatives
One way: One way to do things, not many
Clarity over compatibility: Clear code beats backward compatibility
Throw errors: Fail fast when preconditions aren't met
No backups: Trust the primary mechanism
Separation of concerns: Each function should have a single responsibility
Surgical changes only: Make minimal, focused fixes
Evidence-based debugging: Add minimal, targeted logging
Fix root causes: Address the underlying issue, not just symptoms
Simple > Complex: Let TypeScript catch errors instead of excessive runtime checks
Collaborative process: Work with user to identify most efficient solution
